    <h4> Description</h4>
    Quick and easy 10 minute homemade bagel recipe. If you are in a rush for something quick and delicious, this is for you! All you need are bagels, pasta sauce of your choice, and toppings of your choice. I wil be showing you how to make my favorite kind, pepperoni pizza, bagel style! My favorite way is to buy a log of pepperoni and cut thick slices so the pepperoni curls up.
