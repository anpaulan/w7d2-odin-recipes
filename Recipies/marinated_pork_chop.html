    <h4> Description</h4>
    Quick and easy marinade for a one pan pork chop dish. Simple 5 ingredient recipe for a weeknight dinner. Quick and minimal preperation using pork chops, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, onion(optional), and garlic(optional). All you really need is 30 minutes to marinade, but the longer the better.
</p>

<h4> Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Pork chops</li>
    <li>Quarter cup of soy sauce (per pork chop)</li>
    <li>Quarter cup of balsamic vinegar (per pork chop)</li>
    <li>Half an Onion per chop (optional, but recommended)</li>
    <li>Garlic, as little or as much as you want (optional, but recommended)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Take equal parts balsamic and soy and add it to a container or a ziplock </li>
    <li>Try to cover most of the pork chops, but optionally you can flip the chops over to get the most out of your marinade if you are not using a ziplock bag</li>
    <li>Slice your onions into match sticks </li>
    <li>Mince your garlic</li>
    <li>Add the onions and garlic to your marinade</li>
    <li>Add a high smoke point oil to the pan on medium to high heat</li>
    <li>Cook the pork chop until your desired doneness, flip occasionally to prevent burning</li>
    <li>Add water to the pan if you feel your glaze is reducing too quickly to prevent burning</li>
    <li>Let your pork chops rest: ideally equal to the amount of time spent cooking</li>
    <li>If you added onions, add them to the pan on medium to medium high heat</li>
    <li>Cook the onions until your desired texture is achieved</li>
    <li>If you want to take your onions further, add water and lower the heat to get more carmelized onions</li>
    <li>The marinade should have thickened up to a glaze texture</li>
</ol>
